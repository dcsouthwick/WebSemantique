:desc """What is the most-produced play at Yale? Who starred with Lupita Nyong'o, Meryl Streep, and Paul Giamatti when they were students? Ensemble@Yale is an experiment that aims to answer these questions and more by transforming historical theater programs from Yaleâ€™s archives into searchable text through crowdsourced transcription. Rather than reproducing all of the words in a digitized document, as with optical character recognition (OCR), crowdsourced transcription relies on human judgment to create structured data and identify features of interest to scholars and theater enthusiasts.""";
